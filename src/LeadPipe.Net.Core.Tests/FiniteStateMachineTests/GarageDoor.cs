 * About This Example
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This is an example of how you might use a Finite State Machine implementation in order to give something (a garage
 * door in our case) FSM characteristics and capabilities. By using the FSM implementation, we're standardizing how
 * these characteristics and capabilities are granted as well as taking advantage of features such as History. Without
 * a reasonable FSM implementation, business rules, codes, statuses, states, and so forth can become scattered and hard
 * to decipher and debug.
 *
 * It should be noted that this particular example is moderately verbose. It isn't necessary to define all of the
 * methods, properties, enumerations, and so forth as shown here. It's also not necessary to put everything into a
 * single class. You may choose to use partial classes or even create your own FSM that the owning type holds a single
 * reference to. Ultimately, you have to decide what's right based on the circumstances.
 *
 * Finite State Machine
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A Finite State Machine (FSM) is the mechanism by which we can model an abstract machine by defining a finite number
 * of States as well as the Transitions between those States. For example, a door may be considered an FSM in that it
 * has States (open and closed) as well as Transitions (open and close) that are triggered by Events (opened and
 * closed) that are invoked by object methods (door.Open and door.Close).
 *
 * State
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The values of an object's attributes represent State. For example, if a door is anything more than closed then it
 * is considered to be in the open state (Door.PercentOpen > 0).
 *
 * Transitions
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * When certain Events occur, an object progresses from one State to another. For example, when a door (object) is
 * opened (Event), it changes (Transition) from closed (State) to open (State). Each State defines what is possible by
 * registering Transitions. Each Transition causes the object to arrive at a particular State. Transitions often have
 * one or more business rules that determine if the they can be executed.
 *
 * Transition Reasons
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * When a Transition occurs, we often want to know why it occurred. For example, when a door transitions from closed to
 * open, we might like to know why. The simplest form is to simply say that the reason it transitioned from closed to
 * open is because it was opened. On the other hand, if our door were perhaps the door to a bank vault, we might want
 * more explicit reasons such as "Depositing Money", "Withdrawing Money", and "Security Check".
 *
 * Events
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * When something important happens to an object, it is considered an Event. For example, when someone encounters a
 * door (object) that is closed (State), they may choose to open it (object.Method) which causes the door to be opened
 * (Event) which, in turn, causes it to change (Transition) from closed (State) to open (State).
 *
 * A Note About Status Versus State
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It's far too common for novices to confuse State with Status. In some cases, a literal one-to-one translation is
 * just fine. For example, it may be enough to say that a door's Status is the same as its State (open or closed). More
 * often than not, however, Status is actually more than just State. For example, while a door's State is either open
 * or closed, it's Status might be open, closed and unlocked, closed and locked, and so on. In other words, Status is
 * often just a read-only representation of a combination of State with other information.
